# melody-machine

Create a basic layout for a music player with the following controls:
- Play/pause button
- Next track button
- Previous track button
- Volume control
- Progress bar showing the current position in the song

Use Chakra UI components for the buttons and sliders. Arrange the controls in a logical and user-friendly layout.

For now, the buttons and sliders don't need to be functional. We will add the actual functionality to play music in a later task.
